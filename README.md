Maze Solver: Navigating Paths with Dijkstra's, A*,
and BFS Algorithms

Dijkstra's, A*, and BFS are powerful algorithms used for maze solving.
Dijkstra's and A* consider edge weights, with A* incorporating a heuristic for added
efficiency, while BFS explores all possibilities without considering weights. The
choice of algorithm depends on the characteristics of the maze and the specific
requirements of the application.
